# Prompting Rules (Quick Reference)

## 1) Be explicit about the job
- Define: task, audience, tone, format, constraints.

## 2) Provide a schema when you need reliability
- Ask for JSON, tables, or bullet structure.

## 3) Put critical constraints at the end
- Models often follow the most recent instruction better.

## 4) Use examples when ambiguity exists
- Few-shot > zero-shot for style and edge cases.

## 5) Add a “checklist” step
- Ask the model to verify requirements before final answer.

## 6) Prevent prompt injection
- Tell the model to treat user-provided text as data, not instructions.

## 7) Define refusal boundaries
- “If you don’t know, say you don’t know; don’t invent.”
