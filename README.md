# Prompt Engineering Cookbook (Job-Ready)

A practical collection of prompt patterns used in production LLM apps.

## What’s inside
- Zero-shot / Few-shot prompting
- Role prompting
- Structured outputs (JSON)
- Rubric-based evaluation
- Prompt injection defenses
- Tool-use templates

## How to use
Pick a pattern from `/prompts`, paste into your LLM app (OpenAI / Claude / local LLM), and adapt the variables.

## Suggested way to show this in interviews
- Explain: “I maintain a reusable prompt library and evaluate prompt variants.”
- Show: structured outputs + injection defense + rubric grading.
